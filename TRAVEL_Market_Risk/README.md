# Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council of the ECB sets the key interest rates for the euro area. These are as follows:

**Deposit facility:**
The rate on the deposit facility, which banks may use to make overnight deposits with the Eurosystem at a pre-set interest rate. The Governing Council decided in March 2024 to continue to steer the monetary policy stance through this rate.

**Main refinancing operations:**
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations. In these operations banks can borrow funds from the ECB against broad collateral on a weekly basis at a pre-determined interest rate. The rate is set above the deposit facility rate.

**Marginal lending facility:**
The rate on the marginal lending facility, which offers overnight credit to banks against broad collateral at a pre-set interest rate. The rate is set above the main refinancing operations rate.

# The Buffett Indicator: Market Cap to GDP

The Buffett Indicator, also known as Market Cap to GDP, has gained prominence as a long-term valuation indicator for stocks,
largely due to Warren Buffett's endorsement. In a Fortune Magazine interview back in 2001, Buffett referred to it as 
"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment." This statement has drawn attention to 
the indicator's potential significance in assessing market conditions. The calculation of the Buffett Indicator involves
dividing the total market value of all publicly-traded stocks within a country by the country's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP). By comparing the stock market's size to the overall economic output, this ratio provides insights into the 
relative valuation of the market. To illustrate this concept, one common approach is to examine the ratio between the 
Wilshire 5000 and the GDP of the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is widely regarded as the definitive benchmark for 
the US equity market, aiming to measure the total market capitalization of all US equity securities with readily 
available price data. By dividing this market index by the GDP, we can obtain a snapshot of the market's valuation in 
relation to the country's economic performance.
